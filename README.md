# Heterogenous-ensemble
I use a data set from this repository that pertains to health insurance to illustrate the heterogenous ensemble method. Pandas, which is used to read files, and Sklearn are among the different libraries used. First, the dataset is loaded, and any missing values are inspected. The insurance dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical values and eliminating unnecessary columns, in this case, "children" and "region," as they have no bearing on the interpretation of the data. Under the 0.3 test fraction, the data are divided into training and test sets. The different classifiers are then developed. DecisionTree classifier, logistic regression, and random forest classifier in this instance. These three are combined to create three trained-based models that may each be applied to a different prediction.
